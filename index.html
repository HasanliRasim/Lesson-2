        <dt><b>Mixed martial arts</b>
            <dd>Mixed martial arts (MMA)[a] is a full-contact combat sport based on striking, grappling and ground fighting, incorporating techniques from various combat sports from around the world.[10] The first documented use of the term mixed martial arts was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993.</dd>

        <dt><b>Muay Thai</b>
            <dd>Muay Thai sometimes referred to as Thai boxing, is a combat sport that uses stand-up striking, sweeps, and various clinching techniques.[1] This discipline is known as the "Art of eight limbs", as it is characterised by the combined use of fists, elbows, knees and shins.[2] Muay Thai became widespread internationally in the late 20th to 21st century, when Westernised practitioners from Thailand began competing in kickboxing and mixed-rules matches as well as matches under Muay Thai rules around the world. The professional league is governed by The Professional Boxing Association of Thailand (P.A.T.), sanctioned by The Sports Authority of Thailand (S.A.T.).The origin of Muay Thai is subject to scholarly debates. Some believe that Muay Thai ultimately originated from the Khmer pre-Angkorean martial art Bokator,[6][7][8][9] while others maintain it originated in Thailand. Muay Thai is believed to have been developed by the Siamese army as a form of self-defence and it can be traced at least to the 16th century as a peace-time martial art practised by the soldiers of King Naresuan.[10] An exhibition of Muay Thai was observed and reported by Simon de la Loubère, a French diplomat who was sent by King Louis XIV to the Kingdom of Siam in 1687, in his famous work and the Ayutthaya Kingdom Burmese–Siamese War (1765–1767).[11] Muay Boran and therefore Muay Thai, was originally called by more generic names such as Toi Muay or simply Muay.</dd>

        <i>Fiziev was born in Korday, Kazakhstan, to an Azerbaijani father and a Russian mother. When he was a child, Fiziev's family moved to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.When he was a child, Fiziev's father bought him and his cousins boxing gloves and told them to spar. Initially, he did not enjoy sparring, and it was not until he changed schools as a teenager that Fiziev took up Muay Thai at the age of 11 due to being bullied.[10] While he concentrated on Muay Thai growing up, he also took up several other combat sports including combat sambo, boxing, Jiu Jitsu, and wrestling.[10] When switching from Muay Thai to MMA, he says learning the grappling was the toughest part but his striking and standup required adjusting as well.</i>
